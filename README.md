**Fixel** is a web application for image enhancement and transformation. Users can upload or capture images and apply various digital image processing techniques, including **Thresholding**, **Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation**, **Linear Negative Transformation**, and **Morphological Operations**.

---

## 📝 Overview

Fixel is designed to demonstrate practical applications of **image processing techniques** in an interactive way. With a few clicks, users can:

- Enhance images for better visualization
- Apply different transformations for analysis or aesthetic purposes
- Download the enhanced images

## 💻 Features

### Image Enhancement Techniques
1. **Thresholding** – Useful for segmentation, object detection, OCR preprocessing, and edge detection.  
2. **Linear Negative Transformation** – Inverts grayscale images for highlighting dark regions, medical imaging, or photographic negatives.  
3. **Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation** – Nonlinear adjustment of pixel values to control brightness and contrast.  
4. **Morphological Transformation** – Shape-based operations (Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing) for noise removal, hole filling, and edge detection.

### User-Friendly Interface
- Upload images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) or capture with camera
- Select enhancement technique and adjust parameters using sliders
- Compare original and enhanced images side by side
- Download the enhanced image as PNG
